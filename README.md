## Simple tutorials on deep learning using the imperative mode of TensorFlow

This repo aims to help people who would like to start getting hands-on experience with deep learning using the TensorFlow Eager mode. TensorFlow Eager mode lets you build neural networks as easy as you would do with Numpy, with the huge advantage that it provides automatic differentiation (no more handwritten backprop. YAAAY!). It can ran also on GPUs making the neural networks training significantly faster.
I will try to make the tutorials accessible for everyone, thus I will try to work on problems that do not require a GPU to work on.

**TensorFlow Version used in the tutorials - 1.5**

**Here is the list of tutorials available**:
* _Build a simple neural network with TensorFlow Eager_

This tutorial shows how to build a one-hidden layer neural network using the eager mode of TensorFlow, on a synthetically generated dataset.

**To do:**
* Metrics for monitoring the performance of your neural network using TensorFlow Eager
* Using Tensorboard and TensorFlow Eager to visualize the training of your neural network

* Please let me know if you have any suggestions to improve these tutorials. The aim is to help you getting a good grasp of this framework but I am also looking to improve my programming skills so any feedback will be really appreciated :)!
