    "# Building a CNN for emotion recognition in Eager mode\n",
    "----\n",
    "\n",
    "One of my favourite parts about deep learning is that I can work on problems where I can test the neural networks on myself. The most entertaining neural network that I've built so far is a CNN for emotion recognition. I've managed to pass my webcam video through the network and got predictions of my emotions ~real-time (using a GTX-1070). Quite addictive hehe :)!\n",
    "\n",
    "So, if you want to build your own neural network for emotion recognition, using TensorFlow Eager, keep on reading. \n",
    "\n",
    "### There are 3 main steps to do in this tutorial.\n",
    "* *Download the emotion recognition dataset from Kaggle*\n",
    "* *Create a CNN neural network with TensorFlow Eager*\n",
    "* *Test the network on new pictures, or even better, with webcam footage of yourself.*"
